# Left hand mirror layout

Have you wondered whether you can type all the alphebetical letters using a single hand sometimes? So you can then free your right for other activities such as using a mouse, flipping a book page, grabbing a cup of coffee, or even just taking a break from exhausting typing.

It could be easier than you think. Basically you just need to setup a what I refer as mirror keyboard layout like below. The layout is a mirror image of your regular layout.

This way you can type in `i` with your left hand in the position of letter `e`. It's not that difficult to adopt this since you might have practice your right hand a lot so you already kinda of remember what is the mirrored position even you have never used it this way.

## How to setup

A normal keyboard only supports one base layout, however there're keyboards that support multiple layers, so that when one of the special layer key is pressed, it then switches to a different layer. Most of keyboards that supports [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/) do have this feature built-in. Some other commercial mechanical keyboard also allows you customize the keyboard layer. For instance,

> Notice `MO` keys in the above picture. They are layer keys.
