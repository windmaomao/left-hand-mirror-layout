# Left hand mirror layout

Have you wondered whether you can type all the alphebetical letters using a single hand sometimes? So you can then free your right for other activities such as using a mouse, flipping a book page, grabbing a cup of coffee, or even just taking a break from exhausting typing. Here's the [Medium page](https://medium.com/@windmaomao/left-hand-typing-only-with-keyboard-layer-78c8302b113e).

It could be easier than you think. Basically you just need to setup a what I refer as mirror keyboard layout like below. The layout is a mirror image of your regular layout.

This way you can type in `i` with your left hand in the position of letter `e`. It's not that difficult to adopt this since you might have practice your right hand a lot so you already kinda of remember what is the mirrored position even you have never used it this way.

## How to setup

A normal keyboard only supports one base layout, however there're keyboards that support multiple layers, so that when one of the special layer key is pressed, it then switches to a different layer. Most of keyboards that supports [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/) do have this feature built-in. Some other commercial mechanical keyboard also allows you customize the keyboard layer. For instance,

> Notice `MO` keys in the above picture. They are layer keys. 

## Where to map the layer key

There're two main locations to map the layer keys.

- map the layer key to your left hand
- map the layer key to your right hand

If you map the layer key to your left hand, ex. using a thumb finger, you literally can start to type with your left hand only, which is really nice and fluid. And this could free your right hand entirely. 

There's another way, you could also map the layer key to your right hand, ex. using a index finger, so it'll behave like a shift key sort of way. Though you still need your right hand, I found it quite effective as well.

> As long as one of your hand is not doing the typing, that shall give some break to that hand.
